1. If the exact bank name is unclear, call list_banks (optionally with search) and let me pick.
2. Call start_consent with the exact name. Show me the URL as a plain link and tell me to open it, log in at the bank and approve read-only access. Mention how long the consent lasts.
3. When I say I am done, call consent_status and list_accounts. Summarise what got linked.
4. Suggest a short label for each account based on its name and product, and offer to set them with set_account_label so I can refer to accounts by name.

Steps:
1. Call list_accounts. Skip loan and mortgage accounts for spending; note their balance separately.
2. For every current account call get_transactions for the month (from the 1st to the last day). Follow continuation keys until you have everything.
3. Identify transfers between my own accounts: same amount, opposite sign, within two days, across two of my accounts. Exclude both legs from income and spending.
4. Categorise the rest. If a categorisation skill or rules file is available, use it; otherwise use sensible categories (housing, groceries, transport, eating out, subscriptions, shopping, health, kids, travel, income, other).
5. Present: total income, total spending, net, savings rate; a table of spending by category with the share of total; the ten largest single expenses; recurring items you noticed. Amounts in the account currency, no decimals.
6. Close with two or three observations worth acting on. Be concrete and short.

    },
    ({ months }) =>
      text(
        `Audit my recurring charges over the last ${months ?? "6"} months.

1. Call list_accounts, then get_transactions for each current account over the whole period (follow continuation keys).
2. Find debits that repeat with a regular cadence (monthly, quarterly, yearly) from the same counterparty or with the same description. Card payments to the same merchant with slightly varying amounts still count.
3. For each: name, cadence, latest amount, yearly cost, first seen, and whether the amount went up during the period.
4. Flag: subscriptions that started in the last two months, price increases, duplicates (same service charged twice), and anything that looks unused or forgotten.
5. Present a table sorted by yearly cost, the total per year, and a short list of candidates to cancel with the yearly saving for each.

    ({ days }) =>
      text(
        `Look for unusual transactions in the last ${days ?? "30"} days.

1. Call list_accounts, then for each current account get_transactions for the last ${days ?? "30"} days and, for comparison, the 90 days before that.
2. Report: single debits far larger than that counterparty's usual amount or than my typical spending; possible duplicate charges (same counterparty, same amount, within three days); counterparties that never appeared in the comparison period; incoming payments that are not salary or transfers from my own accounts; pending transactions older than a week.
3. For every item give date, account, counterparty, amount and a one-line reason it stood out. Skip anything that is clearly normal. If nothing is unusual, say so in one sentence.
